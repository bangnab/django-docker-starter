# Django Docker starter

Basic Django starter project with Docker configuration to run with Postgres DB.

## Usage
To start developing simply start the server with

```docker-compose up```

This will also mount the current directory in the docker container and apply changes to existing files automatically.
Note that new files are not automatically tracked and you need to restart the server to see their effect.
